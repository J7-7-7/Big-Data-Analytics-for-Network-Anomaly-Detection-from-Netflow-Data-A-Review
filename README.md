# Big-Data-Analytics-for-Network-Anomaly-Detection-from-Netflow-Data-A-Review

In this study, I used a variety of machine learning and deep 
learning models to determine whether network traffic is botnet 
or not. A botnet is a network of hijacked computers and devices 
that have been infected with bot malware and are remotely 
controlled by a hacker. The bot network is used to generate 
spam and perform DDoS assaults, and it may be rented out to 
other cybercriminals.
This proposed approach can be utilised to detect botnet traffic in 
a variety of applications. The captured netflow data can be fed 
into the model, which will predict whether the network flow is 
caused by a botnet or a normal packet flow.
